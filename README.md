# Margaret Vs David
##Answering the question that 21 million Australian's have never asked...

I'm currently doing two things:
* Learning more of what I love - computers, data and programming
* Starting a blog

These two outlets have led to my first project, *Margaret vs David: The Return*.

##Who are Margaret & David?
They are two well known Australian movie critics, who ended their run in 2014. I was learning some simple similarity calculations (Person, Euclidian), and thought I would do this.

This then evolved into what I'm doing now.

##Process
I've just learnt Python, and absolutely love it. I'm now in the process of learning R as well, so it will use a combination of these tools.

In the folder 'Data', there are some python scripts to *scrape* the Margaret & David pages for data. Since then, I've thought of other stratification variables, so will likely add these as I go.
